My intent is to mimic the results of the command shell while adding my own grain of salt by adding my own features.

My command shell currently handles basic commands (e.g. cd, ls, etc.), piping (e.g. |), connectors (e.g. && or ||), and the test functionality, which determines whether a directory/file exists.

I will be updating my repo as implement more features, fix bugs, and the like.
