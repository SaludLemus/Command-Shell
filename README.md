My intent is to mimic the results of the command shell while adding my own grain of salt.

My command shell currently handles basic commands (e.g. cat, ls, etc.), piping (e.g. |), connectors (e.g. && or ||), the test functionality, which determines whether a directory/file exists, redirection (e.g. <, >, >>), and cd.

I will be updating my repo as implement more features, fix bugs, and the like.

NOTE: cd cannot be joined with other features such as cat, connectors, etc.

Executable: rshell
